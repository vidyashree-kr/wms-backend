## Intro
This assignment will be used as a discussion during a technical interview.
The primary values for the code we look for are: simplicity, readability, maintainability, testability. It should be easy to scan the code, and rather quickly understand what it’s doing. Pay attention to naming.
 
You may choose any coding language, and we look forward to discussing your choice.
